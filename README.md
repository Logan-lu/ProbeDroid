# **ProbeDroid**  

ProbeDroid is a ***dynamic Java code instrumentation kit for Android application***. It provides APIs for developers to craft their own instrumentation tools. Thus they can trace, profile, or alter the runtime behavior of an interested application. Essentially, ***Java method*** is the ***basic instrumentation unit***. To manipulate the interested methods, developers should override the template instrumentation gadgets and register them to hook interested methods. During runtime, when those methods are invoked, the control flow is diverted to the gadgets. And it is the timing to manipulate the boxed method input arguments and return value. In the current stage, ProbeDroid targets on Android 5.0 and above. To build ProbeDroid kit, developers just pull the package from GitHub and follow the build commands. Android source tree is not required.  

## **Feature**  
+  Dynamic Java method instrumentation kit for Android app  
   +  Java library as integration interface for developers  
   +  ***Customizable instrumentation gadgets*** to fit different applications  
   +  ***Modifiable method input and output*** to alter app behavior  
+  Direct build procedure ***without Android source dependency***  
   +  Pulling the GitHub source and following the document  
+  Succinct deployment ***without customized ROM or system apps***  
   +  Only ProbeDroid engine and developers' instrumentation package are required  

## **Limitation**  
+  Cannot instrument ***abstract*** and ***native*** methods  
+  Currently only supporting ***Android 5.0*** and the devices based on ***Intel x86*** and ***ARM eabi v7a*** ISAs.

## **Required Build and Deployment Kit**
+  [Android SDK]  
+  [Android NDK]
+  [Apache Ant]


## **How to Compile ProbeDroid Runtime**  
We need [Android NDK] and [Apache Ant] to build ProbeDroid Runtime.

#### **1. Terminology**
The ProbeDroid Runtime is composed of the ***Launcher*** and the ***Engine***:  

+  Launcher - Used to inject the engine and the custom instrumentation package into the target process.  
+  Engine - Used to marshal the control flow between Android Runtime and the instrumentation package.  

The frequently used path name identifiers:  

+  `PATH_IN_HOST` - The absolute path storing ProbeDroid Runtime source in your host machine.  

#### **2. Build Launcher**
1.  Switch to `PATH_IN_HOST/launcher/jni`, and type:  
    ```
    $ ndk-build
    ```  

    The launcher executable should reside in `PATH_IN_HOST/launcher/libs/x86/launcher`.  

#### **3. Build Engine**
1.  Switch to `PATH_IN_HOST/engine/jni`, and type:  
    ```
    $ ndk-build
    ```  

    The native library should reside in `PATH_IN_HOST/engine/libs/x86/libProbeDroid.so`.  

2.  Switch to `PATH_IN_HOST/engine`, and type:  
    ```
    $ ant compile
    $ ant build-jar
    ```  

    The java library jar should reside in `PATH_IN_HOST/engine/ProbeDroid.jar`.  


## **How to Develop Instrumentation Package**
We recommend you to apply [Android Studio] for development.  

1.  Create an Android Studio project.  The ***API level*** should be ***21***.

2.  Import the library jar `ProbeDroid.jar` into the project.  

3.  Develop your own instrumentation tool with the following resource:  
    1.  Refer to [JavaDoc] for the usage of ProbeDroid API.  
    2.  Some [Sample Tools] are provided.  

4. Compile the project as android APK.  

For the detailed development information, please refer to the wiki page [How to Develop Instrumentation Package].


## **How to Start Instrumentation**
We need [Android SDK] to create the virtual device.

#### **1. Terminology**
The frequently used path name identifiers:  

+  `PATH_IN_HOST` - The absolute path storing ProbeDroid Runtime source in your host machine.
+  `PATH_IN_DEVICE` - The working directory in your experiment device. `/data/local/tmp` is recommended.
+  `PATH_YOUR_PACKAGE` - The path storing your instrumentation package.

#### **2. Create Virtual Device**
1.  Create a virtual device with ***Intel x86 ISA*** and ***API level 21***.  

2.  Boot up the virtual device.

3.  Turn off the ***SEAndroid*** mandatory access control:
    ```
    $ su 0 setenforce 0
    ``` 

#### **3. Deploy ProbeDroid Runtime**
1.  Move the ProbeDroid launcher to the experiment device:  
    ```
    $ adb push PATH_IN_HOST/launcher/libs/x86/launcher PATH_IN_DEVICE/
    $ chmod a+x PATH_IN_DEVICE/launcher
    ```

2.  Move the ProbeDroid engine to the experiment device:  
    ```
    $ adb push PATH_IN_HOST/engine/libs/x86/libProbeDroid.so  PATH_IN_DEVICE/
    $ chmod a+x PATH_IN_DEVICE/libProbeDroid.so
    ```

#### **4. Deploy Instrumentation Package**
1.  Move your instrumentation package to the experiment device:  
    ```
    $ adb push PATH_YOUR_PACKAGE PATH_IN_DEVICE
    ```

#### **5. Start Instrumentation**
1.  Run the ProbeDroid launcher.  
    ```
        Usage: ./launcher
            --app    [-a] APPNAME    (The package name (or keyword) of the target app)
            --lib    [-l] LIBPATH    (The *absolute path name* of libProbeDroid.so)
            --module [-m] MODULEPATH (The *absolute path name* of your instrumentation package)
            --class  [-c] CLASSNAME  (The *fully qualified main class name* of your instrumentation package)
    ```  

2.  Monitor the message spewed by logcat daemon.  

For the detailed deployment information, please refer to the wiki page [How to Start Instrumentation].

## **Demo**

#### **Instrument GoogleMaps**
**Click the picture to view the demo vedio**  

| [![GoogleMaps](http://img.youtube.com/vi/6_kg-229yz4/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_kg-229yz4&nohtml5=False) |
|---|
| A simple instrumentation tool which ***tracks the strings converted from StringBuilder object***. By taking some forensics towards the converted strings, you would notice that GoogleMaps applies Java reflection to accomplish some network authentication. Also, It will dynamically generate some C/C++ code and compile it for map rendering. |


#### **Instrument KKTix**
**Click the picture to view the demo vedio**  

| [![KKTix](http://img.youtube.com/vi/KV8gRs0xWQ8/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV8gRs0xWQ8) |
|---|
| A simple instrumentation tool which ***tracks the started Activities and Services***. By taking some forensics towards the tracked components, you would notice that KKTix applies several kinds of Activies to render the ticket booking pages. Also, it starts a  Service for background computation. |
